# Cache-oblivious optimizations of binary search

## Branch-free search

## Prefetch optimization

## Sqrt-optimization

## VEB layout

## Look-Up Tables

And some combinations
Best: branch-free prefetch sqrt optimization - sqrt + prefetch on first step, branch-free + prefetch on second step, best match when all the data fits into cache-line.
